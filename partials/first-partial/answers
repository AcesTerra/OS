1. The output will be 5. This is because, even tough, both share a memory space, neither process can access the
variables of the other process.

2. 8 processes.

3. Three major complications:
	- Undesired user experience. For example: If you were listening music and move to another app, you woul like
	  keep listening music, but the music stops when you change the application. You were not able to read an
	  article from a web site and listen music at the same time.
	- Without background, you should wait until an application finish a task to see the result. You cannot just
	  change to anoher application while the application finish the task. For example: Dowloading a file from a
	  website. You must wait until the file is downloaded.
	- Inefficient core usage. You are taking advantage of the processor to process all data. It becomes sequential
	  instead playing with the processing power you have.

4. Shared memory segments.

5. 16 processes.
